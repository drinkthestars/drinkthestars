### Hi there! 👋  I'm Tasha!

`Welcome & thank you for visiting! ✨✨`


#### 🔮 A little about me
Currently working as an Android engineer. I love learning new things 
and experiencing the variety in dev experience across platforms...

- Most recently been dabbling with [Jetpack Compose 🤖](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
- Also trying to revisit web dev after 7+ years 😅 
- When I'm not coding, I like to dabble in electronic music production 🎛️
